# Automotive Feedback using NLP
Semantic Clustering of Automotive Feedback using Sentence-BERT and HDBSCAN

---

## 📘 Overview

This is an end-to-end NLP pipeline that automatically cleans, embeds, clusters, and labels automotive customer and workshop feedback.

The goal is to group similar issue descriptions (e.g., “steering leather peeling” and “steering leather discolored”) into meaningful clusters without manual labeling, enabling faster root-cause analysis and issue tracking.
